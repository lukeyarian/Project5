## Notes

This app was an absolute nightmare for me, the build files did not want to cooperate and I would constantly change between different versions and different approaches to try to get them to work. Once I finally got the build files to work, I began to work on my code. Once I had my code seemingly in good shape, I started getting an error that wouldn't let me run the app. I researched the error and did every listed step for solving it, but none of them fixed it. I spent hours upon hours trying to debug it, but I can't fix it. If the grader has an idea of why I am getting the error, please let me know as I want to improve and make this app function, but I just can't figure it out from any other resource. It seemed like a simple fix in the XML file, and maybe it is and I am just dumb.
